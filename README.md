# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Summary
In our Pewlett Hackard analysis, we created an Entity Relation Diagram (ERD) with the provided data: Departments, Department Employees, Department Manager, Employees, Titles, and Salaries. Creating the ERD helped us see relationships between each data set. These key factors helped us import and handle the data in SQL phAdmin 4.

Using the employee data set we were able to apply various conditions for retirement eligibility helping us narrow down which employee is eligible for retirement. Here we got that there are 41,380 rows off employees who are eligible. This lets us know how many new open spaces will be available for new employees and new promotions for the following year.

Furthering our analysis, we counted the number of employees in each department to see how big of a size is each department. This can help the company figure out where they need to add more resources or where they could potentially cut employment if needed.

The Employee information table can help the company analyze their entire existing employment group. Which can be order by employee number or salary. Theses are important features when figuring out how long an employee has been with a company or what the a particular employee is costing the company each year.

List of Managers the company know what manager oversees blank department. The one this that is a bit odd in this final output of the data is that there are only 5 managers for 9 different departments. Which means either there are no managers for the other remaining 4 departments or we have these five managers also managing other departments off the record. This is a question which Bobby will need to ask his manager.

Results: A few folks are are appearing twice. Maybe they moved departments?
-- Questions:
-- Whatâ€™s going on with the salaries?
-- Why are there only five active managers for nine departments?
-- Why are some employees appearing twice?
